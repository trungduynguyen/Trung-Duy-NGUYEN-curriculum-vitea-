I am writing to apply for the tenure-track position in mathematics as advertised on the Employment Information in the Mathematical Sciences List. I am a graduate student at Harvard University working in Algebraic Combinatorics under the direction of Professor Stanton Lochs. I expect to complete my PhD by May 2017. My teaching, mentoring, and tutoring experiences, along with my research background, make me a strong candidate to teach both lower-level and upper-level mathematics courses and to make substantial contributions to the academic environment of Dickinson College. My current research centers on enumerating shuffles of permutations. I am very excited to have solved the problem as originally posed, that is: if you shuffle two permutations words with each other, so as to preserve the relative order of the letters in each of the two words, how many distinct shuffle words can be obtained? I have found a formula that gives the number of such shuffles, even when the permutations are allowed to differ in length and am presently working on discovering generalizations.  I propose to continue looking at the enumeration of various types of shuffles, but also to branch off into other problems in permutation enumeration. I believe that my projects will address topics that will also be accessible to undergraduate researchers, and I would be thrilled to have the chance to direct undergraduate research projects in combinatorics as well as guide independent studies in any mathematics-related area.As my CV illustrates, I have a broad range of teaching experience, from extensive tutoring and individual mentoring to teaching undergraduate courses in Calculus and Linear Algebra with Differential Equations. In the undergraduate courses at Harvard, I prepare and deliver my own lectures The tone and content of this letter are appropriate for a faculty position at a small liberal arts college.  Margot has effectively communicated why she is a good fit for the position, while expressing enthusiasm for working at Dickinson. To express your interest in a school, in addition to the faculty or department, you might bring in your experience having lived in a similar geographic region, studied in a similar institution, experience or interest in working with a similar population of students, or personal reasons. Note, also, that Margot discusses not only the courses she can teach and her pedagogical approaches, but she also indicates how her research would appeal to undergraduates.  If she were an experimental scientist, it would be important for her to address not only how accessible her research is to under-graduates, but also how feasible it would be for the college to support the research facilities, equipment, etc.Identifying information has been changed.25
